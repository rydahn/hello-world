This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Jesus Ramos, and I have an Associate's Degree in Applied Science, which I earned with honors from Pima Community College in May 2016. During my time at Pima Community College, I specialized in Digital Game and Simulation. As an academically driven individual, I had the privilege of being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society. My educational journey continues as I return to school in the Spring of 2024, where I will pursue a major in Computer Information Systems.
